# Date Night Generator
This is a date night generator coded specifically for Omar and Mara's anniversary.

## User Story
Omar and Mara spend all day together as they wake up in the same bed, work from home in the same room, and eat from the same stove. However content they are spending their lives together, they want a hint of spontaneity that allows them to learn about each other in new ways and explore new things. Right now, there are other date night generators online or in card games. However, those commonly center around drinking which isn't great for a sober date night. But that doesn't mean Omar and Mara don't love a sense of adventure! 
When using this website, Omar and Mara must be able to:
* Add Date Ideas
* Complete Date Ideas (marking them as done once)
* Select Date Ideas based on categories (staying in, going out, weekend trip, etc.) 
* Generate Date Ideas based on whether or not they've done it before

If time allows, Omar and Mara would enjoy:
* Adding a photo to mark the completion of that date
